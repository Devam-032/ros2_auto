# ROS2-Autonomous Car

## Overview
This project involves the development of a reliable autonomous navigation system using ROS2 and Pixy Cam. The primary goal is to ensure the car remains within track boundaries while adapting to dynamic scenarios. My main role was in modifying the python script and implementing a PID controller in such a way that the car never goes off the track.
