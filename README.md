# ROS2-Autonomous Car

## Overview
This project involves the development of a reliable autonomous navigation system using ROS2 and Pixy Cam. The primary goal is to ensure the car remains within track boundaries while adapting to dynamic scenarios.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Implements Python-based control for navigating within boundaries.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Modified algorithms for robust performance in ROS2 environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks/Tools**: ROS2, Pixy Cam
